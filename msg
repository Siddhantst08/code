Dear All,

As many of you already know, today marks my last day at Evalueserve. This place will always be special to me—not just because it was my first company, but because of all the memories, learning, and friendships I’ve built here over the last 1.5 years.

I still remember joining as an intern, full of excitement (and a little nervousness), and since then the journey has been nothing short of amazing. From working on challenging projects with my team members, to sharing endless laughter and conversations with the colleagues who sat right beside me, to the friends I made during my internship and training days—each of you has made this experience truly unforgettable.

Thank you for all the guidance, support, and encouragement you’ve given me. I’ve grown not only professionally but also personally, and I’ll always be grateful to have started my career here with such wonderful people around me.

Although I’m moving on, I’d love to stay in touch. Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn/Email/Phone number].

Wishing you all continued success, and I’m sure our paths will cross again in the future.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
