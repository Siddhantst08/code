Hi Everyone,

As I sit down to write this email, I can’t believe that my journey at Evalueserve is coming to an end. After spending more than 1.5 years here, it feels surreal to say goodbye to the place where I started my professional career, learned so much, and made countless memories.

I still remember my very first day as an intern—excited, nervous, and curious about everything. From those early days of training and trying to find my way, to becoming a full-time team member, this place has given me more than just work experience. It has given me friendships, mentors, and memories that I will carry with me forever.

To my project team—you’ve been my biggest teachers and strongest supporters. I’ve learned not just technical skills, but also teamwork, patience, and collaboration from you. Thank you for always being there to guide me, answer my endless questions, and celebrate even the smallest wins together.

To the colleagues who sat right beside me—thank you for all the small conversations, shared laughter, coffee breaks, and those little moments that made the everyday routine so much fun. Work never felt heavy because of the joy you all brought into it.

And to my friends from internship and training days—you made the early phase of my career so much easier and enjoyable. From struggling through the first assignments together to celebrating our little milestones, those memories will always be close to my heart.

What makes leaving difficult is not the work, but the people. Each of you has played a part in shaping my journey here, and I’m truly grateful for the support, kindness, and warmth I’ve received throughout.

Though I am moving on, I would really love to stay connected. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime at [your email] or connect with me on [LinkedIn link]. I’ll be cheering for all of you from the outside and hope our paths cross again in the future.

Thank you once again for making my first company so special. I will always look back at this chapter of my career with a smile.

Wishing you all success, happiness, and many more celebrations ahead.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
