The core aspects of this type of agreement include:\\n\\n1. **Disclosure and Recipient Obligations**: The agreement allows a party (the \\\"Discloser\\\") to share its confidential information with another party (the \\\"Recipient\\\"). The Recipient is then obligated to treat this information as confidential, not use it outside the scope of the agreement or without written authorization, and protect it with a reasonable degree of care to prevent unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication [1]().\\n\\n2. **Confidentiality Management System**: Evalueserve has established a robust Confidentiality Management System that includes data protection controls tailored to project requirements. This system ensures the protection of project data through physical and logical security controls, secure practices, and restricted access to the Evalueserve Data Centre to the IT team only [2]()[14]().\\n\\n3. **Return or Destruction of Confidential Information**: Upon the expiry or termination of the contract, all documents and records containing confidential information must be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed, as chosen by the Disclosing Party, ensuring no copies are retained [3]().\\n\\n4. **Legal and Process Measures for Confidentiality**: Several legal and process measures are implemented to ensure confidentiality, including non-disclosure agreements, in-house legal counsel for contractual compliance, clean desk policies, least privilege principles, and regular training among others. Additionally, technology measures such as ISO 27001 certification, secure data transmission and storage, and data loss prevention are employed [4]().\\n\\n5. **High Regard for Client Confidentiality**: Evalueserve emphasizes client confidentiality as a core value, demonstrated by its ISO 27001 certification and the implementation of physical and IT security guidelines. This includes the use of physical and IT firewalls to prevent data breaches [5]()[11]().\\n\\n6. **Exemptions and Ownership of Intellectual Property**: The agreement specifies conditions under which the Recipient is not restricted from using the confidential information, such as when the information is obtained from the public domain or from a third party without confidentiality obligations. It also clarifies that the Client remains the sole and exclusive owner of its intellectual property [1]().\\n\\nThis comprehensive approach to confidentiality ensures that sensitive information shared between parties remains protected throughout and after the duration of their agreement, with specific protocols in place for the handling, sharing, and destruction of such information.\",\"prev_modified_query\":\"Describe what kind of confidentiality agreement\",\"suggested_prompts\":[\"How does the confidentiality agreement outline the obligations of both the Discloser and Recipient regarding the treatment of confidential information?\",\"What measures does Evalueserve implement in its Confidentiality Management System to ensure the protection of project data?\",\"What are some of the legal and process measures employed by Evalueserve to uphold confidentiality, apart from non-disclosure agreements?\",\"How does Evalueserve demonstrate its commitment to client confidentiality as a core value, according to the provided references?\",\"In what circumstances is a Recipient not restricted from using confidential information as specified in the agreement, and how is ownership of intellectual property addressed?\"],\"irrelevant\":false,\"traceback_figures_spans\":[],\"search_references\":[{\"reference_no\":14,\"reference_text\":\"1-) 'evalueserve.com    www.evalueserve.com  8.1.6.

The data highlights several key aspects of Gen Z's media consumption:\\n\\n1. **Digital and Streaming Services**: Gen Z has a strong inclination towards digital platforms and streaming services. This is evident from the popularity of Nollywood movies and TV shows across the African continent, which have seen an increase in demand due to new satellite and streaming services. The entertainment industry, including television and film, is adapting to this demand by offering content accessible through these modern platforms [1]().\\n\\n2. **Online and In-Person Training for Media Production**: There's a growing interest among Gen Z in media production, as seen in the efforts to connect job seekers with opportunities in the Nollywood industry. Initiatives such as online and in-person training courses for in-demand production skills, as well as established internship programs, cater to the younger generation's aspirations to be part of the media industry, whether as set designers, production assistants, lighting and sound technicians, or makeup artists [1]().\\n\\n3. **Educational and Social Change Content**: Gen Z also engages with media that promotes educational content and social change.

This indicates a preference for content that not only entertains but also educates and fosters a positive social impact [1]().\\n\\n4. **Engagement with Social and Environmental Campaigns**: Media campaigns that address social and environmental issues resonate with Gen Z. An example is the campaign called \\\"Consecuencias\\\" in the Peruvian Amazon, which engaged millions of people, including Gen Z, to fight environmental crime. The campaign utilized media coverage and the influence of celebrities and opinion leaders to reach a wide audience, demonstrating Gen Z's concern for environmental issues and their responsiveness to media-driven campaigns [1]().\\n\\n5. **Youth-Centric Programming and Family Planning Information**: Media is also a tool for delivering important information and services to Gen Z, such as family planning counseling and education on reproductive health. Youth Hubs and programs like SKILLZ United, which use a youth-led, human-centered design, ensure that media and program interventions meet the specific needs and interests of adolescents, making information accessible and engaging for this demographic [1]().\\n\\nOverall, Gen Z's media consumption is characterized by a preference for digital and streaming content, an interest in media production careers, engagement with educational and socially impactful content, and responsiveness to campaigns addressing environmental and health issues.\",\"prev_modified_query\":\"How do gen z consume media?\",\"suggested_prompts\":[\"How are digital platforms and streaming services influencing the media consumption habits of Gen Z, particularly in regions like Africa with the rise of Nollywood content?\",\"What initiatives and programs are being implemented to support Gen Z's interest in media production careers, especially within industries like Nollywood?\",\"In what ways does Gen Z engage with educational and social change content through media, as exemplified by initiatives like the Uzbek-language cartoon \\\"Ali’s Adventures\\\"?\",\"How do media campaigns addressing social and environmental issues resonate with Gen Z, as demonstrated by examples like the \\\"Consecuencias\\\" campaign in the Peruvian Amazon?\",\"How is media utilized as a tool to provide important information and services to Gen Z, such as family planning counseling and education on reproductive health through programs like SKILLZ United?\"],\"irrelevant\":false,\"traceback_figures_spans\":[],\"search_references\":[{\"reference_no\":1,\"reference_text\":\"1-) 'Enhance media engagements and delivery of extensive civic and voter education.
